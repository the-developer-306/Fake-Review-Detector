        <p>
            The Fake Review Detector uses advanced machine learning models to determine if a review is genuine or fake.
            It analyzes review content, rating, and helpful votes to make an accurate prediction.

            one.
            It considers the sentiment, review length, and other features to classify the review accurately.
